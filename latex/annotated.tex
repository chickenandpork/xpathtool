Here are the data structures with brief descriptions\-:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{{\bf No\-Document\-Exception} \\*Exception to show that no document has yet been loaded or is available for consideration }{\pageref{classorg_1_1smallfoot_1_1xpath_1_1NoDocumentException}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{{\bf version} \\*Version is used to allow a package that uses this package to be able to \char`\"{}ask\char`\"{} the jar file what version it is }{\pageref{classorg_1_1smallfoot_1_1xpath_1_1version}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{{\bf X\-Path\-Set} \\*A driving class to interpret commandline arguments and pass them to the underlying \doxyref{X\-Path\-Tool}{p.}{classorg_1_1smallfoot_1_1xpath_1_1XPathTool} }{\pageref{classorg_1_1smallfoot_1_1xpath_1_1XPathSet}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{{\bf X\-Path\-Sub} \\*A driving class to interpret commandline arguments and pass them to the underlying \doxyref{X\-Path\-Tool}{p.}{classorg_1_1smallfoot_1_1xpath_1_1XPathTool} }{\pageref{classorg_1_1smallfoot_1_1xpath_1_1XPathSub}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{{\bf X\-Path\-Tool} \\*\doxyref{X\-Path\-Tool}{p.}{classorg_1_1smallfoot_1_1xpath_1_1XPathTool} is a relatively uncomplicated wrapper for an X\-Path action\-: it doesn't know what you're doing, and doesn't assume you'll do things in a specific order, but tries to stop you from making really silly errors like saving or searching an unloaded file }{\pageref{classorg_1_1smallfoot_1_1xpath_1_1XPathTool}}{}
